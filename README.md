### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ I'm a Bioinformatics Engineer working at [Dynamic Biosystems](http://www.dynamic-biosystems.com/).  
ðŸŒ± I have research experience both in Bioinformatic and Experimental fields. Single cell data analysis is one of my specialties.  
ðŸ˜„ I'm keen to apply bioinformatic methdology to elucidate the mechanisms of dieases. Data Visualization and R pkg development      are also interested.
