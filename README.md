### Hi there 👋
🔭 I'm a Bioinformatics Engineer.  
🌱 I have research experience both in Bioinformatic and Experimental fields. Two years experience in Single cell data analysis.  
😄 I'm keen to apply bioinformatic methdology to elucidate the mechanisms of dieases.  
⚡ Data Visualization and tools development are also interested.
